# RDM_BOT_DISCORD
A advanced Discord bot to send DM to a specific role or to all the members of a specific server.
As it is not possible to have the "node_modules" folder to be uploaded I request all the users of this code and bot to execute the following commands before using them in the folder location of the index.js file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your are on a LINUX based system, open the terminal in the location of index.js.
Run "npm -i" (without quotes), this will install all the dependencies required for the bot to run.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are on a WINDOWS based system, start the Commmand Prompt (CMD) and get to the location of index.js for this code.
Run "npm -i" (without quotes), this will install all the dependencies required for the bot to run.
